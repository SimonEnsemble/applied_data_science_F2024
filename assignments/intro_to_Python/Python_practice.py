        # modeling and visualizing the trajectory of a projectile 

        âš¾ write a [`class`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) `Projectile` that models the vertical ($y$-direction) and horizontal ($x$-direction) displacement of a projectile using the kinetic equations [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion#Displacement). 

        endow the `Projectile` class with two _attributes_: 
        (i) the magnitude [m/s] of its initial velocity and
        (ii) the direction of its initial velocity vector, described by its angle [radians] with the x-axis. 
        (assume the projectile begins, at time $t=0$, at the origin $(x=0, y=0)$ which is a point on the ground. so, you don't need to store the initial position.)

        endow the `Projectile` class with the _methods_ that enable:

        * computing and returning the $x$ position of the projectile at arbitrary time $t$
        * computing and returning the $y$ position of the projectile at arbitrary time $t$
        * computing and returning the time of flight of the projectile
        * computing and returning the horizontal range of the projectile
        * computing and returning the maximum height reached by the projectile
        * visualizing the historical path and current position of the projectile at arbitrary time $t$ using [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/). this method should call some of the previously coded methods.
            * enforce equal scaling on the $x$- and $y$ axes to give physical perspective about the shape of the trajectory
            * impose fixed $x$ limits, from zero to 110% of the horizontal range.
            * impose fixed $y$ limits, from zero to 110% of the maximum height reached.
            * label the x- and y-axes and indicate units in the label.

        ## automating the reading of data from files output from an instrument

        often, an instrument in a lab outputs a single file per analysis of a sample.
        then, it is advantageous to have a `class` that reads the data from such a file and populates attributes of the sample and measurements. the following problem exemplifies.

        ðŸŒ± the files `sample_*.txt` contain information about (triclinic) crystal structures of different metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) from the supporting information of a publication ([link](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja500330a)). 
        create a class `Crystal` whose constructor, whose argument is an integer `i`, reads from the file `sample_{i}.txt` (i) the crystal lattice lengths `a`, `b`, and `c`, (ii) the crystal lattice angles `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma`, and (iii) MOF name, and stores them as attributes. also create two methods for the `Crystal` class, one that computes and returns the volume of the crystal lattice (see the formula for the volume of a triclinc system [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravais_lattice#In_3_dimensions)) and another that prints the name of the MOF, the values of the lattice parameters with their units, and the volume of the lattice with the appropriate units.
