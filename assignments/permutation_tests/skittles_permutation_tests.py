            this fun assignment is a modified version of [lab 4](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2023-sp/blob/main/labs/04-hyp-perm/lab.ipynb) in Berkeley's course "Data 8: The Foundations of Data Science" 2023.

        Skittles are made in two locations in the United States: Yorkville, Illinois and Waco, Texas. 
        in these factories, Skittles of different colors are made separately by different machines and combined/packaged into bags for sale. 

        ::bx:data:: the tab-separated file `skittles.tsv` contains data regarding the composition (in terms of counts of red, orange, yellow, green, and purple skittles) of a sample of 468 bags of Skittles produced at the two factories.

        !!! important
            this is just a small _sample_ of the _many_ bags produced at these factories.

        we will compare the color distribution of Skittles between bags made in the Yorkville factory and bags made in the Waco factory. most people have preferences for their favorite flavor, and there is a surprising amount of variation among the distribution of flavors in each bag.

        ## A/B tests on colors of skittles among the two factories

        first, we'll use a permutation test to assess whether, on average, bags made in Yorkville have the same number of `color` skittles as bags made in Waco, with `color` being "orange", "green", "red", "purple", or "yellow". the goal here is to write Python functions to do this.

        ::icon-park-outline:candy:: below, implement the following functions for such A/B tests:

        * `diff_of_means`: takes in a `DataFrame` like `skittles` and a `color` and returns the absolute difference between the mean number of `color` Skittles per bag from Yorkville and the mean number of `color` Skittles per bag from Waco.

        * `simulate_null`: takes in the original `skittles` `DataFrame` and returns one simulated instance of the data under the null hypothesis. specifically, this will involve shuffling the 'Factory' column.

        * `simulate_test_stat_under_null`: takes in the original `skittles` `DataFrame` and a `color` and returns one simulated instance of the test statistic (pertaining to that `color`) under the null hypothesis.

        * `pval_color`: takes in the original `skittles` `DataFrame` and a `color` and calculates the p-value for the permutation test using 1500 trials.

        !!! note
            looking ahead when we consider different colors, we're endowing most of our functions above with an argument `color` so they work for any color.

        !!! tip
            test each of your functions after you write them to make sure they do what you want.

        some guidance:

          * our previous permutation tests have compared the mean number of (say) orange Skittles in Yorkville bags to the mean number number of orange Skittles in Waco bags. The role of shuffling was to randomly assign bags to Yorkville and Waco.
          * in this permutation test, we are still shuffling to randomly assign bags to Yorkville and Waco. the only difference is that after we randomly assign each bag to a factory, we will compute the distribution among colors between the two factories and compute the TVD between those two distributions.
